This is a notebook used for studying Bayesian inference in computational intelligence, which is focused on its theoretical applications and is oriented towards reasoning and decision making. The R programming language was chosen for the practical part of this project, given its orientation towards statistical analysis, ease of use and modular nature makes it well suited for this kind of task.
