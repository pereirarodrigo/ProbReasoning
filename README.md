# bayesianInference

Besides traditional probability, Bayes' theorem plays a huge role in computational intelligence, which is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that's mainly concerned with a biologically-inspired approach to intelligence. Bayesian inference is often one of the pillars behind computational learning theory, and it works by applying concepts of statistical inference in such a way that, as more information becomes available, a hypothesis is repeatedly updated and perfected.

This project is heavily inspired by, and based on, the "An Introduction to Bayesian Thinking" book, which available here: https://statswithr.github.io/book/. Personal notes and experiments are also in this study.
