Bayes' theorem plays a huge role in computational intelligence, a sub-field of artificial intelligence that's mainly concerned with a biologically-inspired approach to machine intelligence. Bayesian inference is often one of the pillars behind computational learning theory, and it works by applying concepts of statistical inference in such a way that, as more information becomes available, a hypothesis is repeatedly updated and perfected.

This project is heavily inspired by, and based on, the "An Introduction to Bayesian Thinking" book, which available here: https://statswithr.github.io/book/. Personal notes and experiments are also included in this study.

Please note that covering all topics of Bayesian inference is a very daunting task, as it has connections to wildly different statistical subjects. Thus, most of the focus here is on exploring its impact solely on computational intelligence.
